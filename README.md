This repository contains the code for building a language identification model using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset of text samples in different languages and can predict the language of a given input text.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is divided into two parts: train and test. The train dataset is used for training the machine learning model and the test dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the model.

Both datasets are located in the datasets folder. The train dataset is stored in the Language Detection.csv file and the test dataset is stored in the Language_test_data.csv file.

Each row of the dataset contains a text sample and its corresponding language. The languages included in the dataset are English, Spanish, French, Tamil and etc..,

Dependencies
